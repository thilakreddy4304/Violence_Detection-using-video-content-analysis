Executing the source code:
--------------------------
1. run the initial_test.py file and make sure that it displays the message as 
	"successfully opened dynamic library cuda"
2. run the run.py file 
3. Wait till it asks "Enter the video name:"
4. Enter any random video name present in the Final_Test folder to test.
5. A window will be popped classifying the input video as "Violence" or "Non-Violence" with Accuracy.
